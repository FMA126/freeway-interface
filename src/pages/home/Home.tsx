        The Freeway DAO is a community owned ride sharing platform.  There are riders and drivers.  There will be two different NFT types available to mint: Driver NFT, and Rider NFT.  There will also be a governance token, FREEWAY, that will allow 
        holders to participate in the governance of the platform.  At launch there will be a limited amount of the Driver NFTs
        available to mint but the community can raise the driver ceiling by vote.  
      </p>
      <p>
        By initially limiting the number of drivers,
        the Driver NFT will have a high demand.  To drive for the Freeway DAO a driver needs to own a Driver NFT.

        The tokenomics of the FREEWAY token is not decided yet but a significant percentage will be issued to users of the 
        platform.
