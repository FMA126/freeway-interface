## Description

The Freeway DAO is a community owned ride sharing platform.  There are riders and drivers.  There will be two different
NFT types available to mint: Driver NFT, and Rider NFT.  There will also be a governance token, FREEWAY, that will allow 
holders to participate in the governance of the platform.  At launch there will be a limited amount of the Driver NFTs
available to mint but the community can raise the driver ceiling by vote.  By initially limiting the number of drivers,
the Driver NFT will have a high demand.  To drive for the Freeway DAO a driver needs to own a Driver NFT.

The tokenomics of the FREEWAY token is not decided yet but a significant percentage will be issued to users of the 
platform.
